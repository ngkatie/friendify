## How the Application Works
### Authentication and Authorization
* Upon opening http://localhost:3000 in a browser, the landing page will load, with options to _Log In_ or _Register_. 
* Non-authenticated users will not be able to access any page but the landing, login, and registration pages.
* At login, users will be redirected to Spotify to log in with their Spotify credentials. This is necessary for authorizing Friendify to access the user's Spotify data.
### User Dashboard and Music History
* After login, authenticated users will be able to access their user dashboard, displaying their profile information, like count, and comments.
* Using the navigation bar, authenticated users can view information about their _Top Tracks_ and _Top Artists_ across three time ranges. The application also generates a _Daily Playlist_ of personalized recommendations, recently played, tracks from top charts, and the user's old favorites.
### Friends
* Under the _Friends_ page, users can send friend requests by email. Users on the receiving end of a friend request can accept or reject the request.
* Friends will be able to view each other's profiles to view their _Music Compatibility Score_, _Top Shared Track_, and _Top Shared Artist_.
* Friends can like and comment on each other's profiles. Comments on a user's pages, as well as their total like count, are visible to all his/her friends.
### Logout
* Press _Logout_ to log out of Friendify. To fully log out, users must log out of Spotify via the link provided at logout.
